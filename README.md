## Notes

stopped here "Now that we have a well-written failing test, let's fix the code, using an if."
right before here: https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/go-fundamentals/hello-world#back-to-source-control

> Have a look through the [strings](https://pkg.go.dev/strings) package. Find functions you think could be useful and experiment with them by writing tests like we have here. Investing time learning the standard library will really pay off over time.

Might be a good idea to come up with a bunch of mini examples and tests to practice using the standard library.
